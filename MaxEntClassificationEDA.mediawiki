<tt>MaxEntClassificationEDA</tt> is an Entailment Decision Algorithm (EDA) based on a prototype system called TIE (Textual Inference Engine), which is developed and maintained by [[Rui Wang|http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~rwang/]] and his colleagues in the [[Language Technology (LT) lab of DFKI GmbH|http://www.dfki.de/lt/]].

Notice that technically running <tt>MaxEntClassificationEDA</tt> does not require additional installation or building steps apart from [[Detailed-manual-for-novice-users|setting up the EOP]]. Also, among the knowledge resources that should be manually installed by the users (explained [[here in the manual | https://github.com/hltfbk/Excitement-Open-Platform/wiki/Detailed-manual-for-novice-users#the-gpl-v3-incompatible-resources]]), we highly recommend the users to [[Treetagger-installation | install TreeTagger]] in order to use most of the components described below. Other required knowledge resources for each of the configurations are described below.

Here are the configurations you could setup for <tt>MaxEntClassificationEDA</tt>.

==Configuration File==
There is a list of pre-defined configuration files which can be found at <tt>/config</tt> and also in the eop-resources archive at <tt>eop-resources/configuration-file/</tt>. Most values in the configuration file can stay exactly as provided. We bring here the details of some of the values you may wish (or need) to change.

===Common settings===

{|
|-

|-
| <tt>PlatformConfiguration</tt>
| <tt>activatedEDA</tt>
| It's the common setting for selecting the EDA. The default value here is <tt>eu.excitementproject.eop.
core.MaxEntClassificationEDA</tt>.
| N/A

|-
| <tt>PlatformConfiguration</tt>
| <tt>language</tt>
| For the moment, <tt>MaxEntClassificationEDA</tt> supports English (<tt>EN</tt>), German (<tt>DE</tt>), and Italian (<tt>IT</tt>). In principle, the EDA is language-independent. The default value is <tt>EN</tt>.
| N/A

|-
| <tt>PlatformConfiguration</tt>
| <tt>activatedLAP</tt>
| The linguistic analysis pipeline needed for the EDA. The default value is <tt>eu.excitementproject.eop.lap.
dkpro.MaltParserEN</tt>. Notice that the <tt>EN</tt> indicates the language flag.
| N/A

|-
| <tt>eu.excitementproject.eop.
core.MaxEntClassificationEDA</tt>
| <tt>modelFile</tt>
| The location where the trained model is stored. The default location is under <tt>./src/test/resources/model/</tt>. The conventional name for a model consists of the EDA name, the settings, and the language flag. For instance, MaxEntClassificationEDAModel_Base
+TS_DE means a German model using the bag-of-words similarity, the bag-of-lemmas similarity and the tree skeleton similarity. The default value is usually the same as the configuration file name.
| For training, the model file should <b>NOT</b> exist; for testing, the path to the model file should be <b>updated</b> correctly.

|-
| <tt>eu.excitementproject.eop.
core.MaxEntClassificationEDA</tt>
| <tt>trainDir</tt>
| The directory contains the training data. The data should be (linguistically) preprocessed and serialized into <tt>xmi</tt> files. The default value is <tt>./target/EN/dev/</tt>. Notice that the <tt>EN</tt> indicates the language flag.
| The directory should exist.

|-
| <tt>eu.excitementproject.eop.
core.MaxEntClassificationEDA</tt>
| <tt>testDir</tt>
| The directory contains the testing data. The data should be (linguistically) preprocessed and serialized into <tt>xmi</tt> files. The default value is <tt>./target/EN/test/</tt>. Notice that the <tt>EN</tt> indicates the language flag.
| The directory should exist.

|-
| <tt>eu.excitementproject.eop.
core.MaxEntClassificationEDA</tt>
| <tt>classifier</tt>
| The setting for the maximum entropy classifier. For the moment, there are two parameters supported, maximum iteration number and the cutoff threshold, which are separated by comma. The default value is <tt>10000,1</tt>.
| N/A

|-
| <tt>eu.excitementproject.eop.
core.MaxEntClassificationEDA</tt>
| <tt>Components</tt>
| The list of components used in the EDA, which are separated by comma. Notice that each of the components needs to have a separate section in the configuration file. Otherwise, there will be a <tt>ConfigurationException</tt>.
| N/A

|-
| <tt>BagOfWordsScoring</tt>
| N/A
| The bag-of-words scoring component. There is no further settings supported.
| The LAP should include a tokenizer, e.g., <tt>OpenNLPTaggerEN</tt>.

|-
| <tt>BagOfLemmasScoring</tt>
| N/A
| The bag-of-lemmas scoring component. There is no further settings supported.
| The LAP should include a tokenizer and a lemmatizer, e.g., <tt>TreeTaggerEN</tt>.

|-
| <tt> BagOfDepsScoring </tt>
| N/A
| The bag-of-dependencies (without POS tags) scoring component. There is no further settings supported.
| The LAP should include syntactic analysis, e.g., <tt>MaltParserEN</tt>.

|-
| <tt> BagOfDepsPosScoring </tt>
| N/A
| The bag-of-dependencies (with POS tags) scoring component. There is no further settings supported.
| The LAP should include syntactic analysis, e.g., <tt>MaltParserEN</tt>.

|-
| <tt> TreeSkeletonScoring </tt>
| N/A
| The tree skeleton scoring component. There is no further settings supported.
