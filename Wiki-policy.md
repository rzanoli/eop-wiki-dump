Using Wiki for Open Source Software (OSS) development is still controversial. Although it is a very useful tool, refusing to follow a unified policy will result in an inconsistent documentation. Therefore, please respect the policy defined here. We reserve the right to change this policy at anytime without notifications. Moreover, violation of this policy might result in deletion of your content and/or revocation of your user rights and/or user account for limited or unlimited time.

1. In order to contribute to the content, you should have a user account.
2. Please only use English for the documentation.
3. Try to use proper page titles and avoid creating duplicate pages. Please first check out the previously created pages.
4. Please do not edit pages without carefully reading them. Do not add your content somewhere in the middle of other irrelevant contents.
5. Annotate those parts which still need future work, clarification and/or explanation and/or verification with @TODO annotation marks. Please note that not all of such cases are for the upcoming release.
6. The idea behind using a Wiki, is to be able to quickly develop a large number of inter-linked web-pages in a collaborative manner. Therefore, try to use relevant internal and external links as much as possible. However, please avoid using irrelevant and/or advertising links.
