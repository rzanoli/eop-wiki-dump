If you would like to put images in your documentation on the Wiki,
please commit them to the wiki-images directory that resides in the
EOP distribution's Git repository (in the gh-pages branch):

https://github.com/hltfbk/Excitement-Open-Platform/tree/gh-pages/wiki-images/

Then, go to the Git repository on Github, obtain the raw URL to your
image by opening the image and clicking on the button "Raw".

We have committed one sample image here:

https://github.com/hltfbk/Excitement-Open-Platform/blob/gh-pages/wiki-images/Dijkstra.jpg

and got the Raw URL. Now, you may test it by copying and pasting the
following line on the Wiki:

`![Dijkstra](https://raw.github.com/hltfbk/Excitement-Open-Platform/gh-pages/wiki-images/Dijkstra.jpg?login=amirhmoin&token=53a992d299b7fab693ddf180853951ca)`

Please note that this only works if the edit mode of the Wiki page
(shown on the top right of the page) is set to Markdown. However,
because of the more organized layout of MediaWiki, I've already set this
on many pages to MediaWiki. On those pages, we should either simply put
the URL of that image (like below) or switch back to Markdown (this
requires changing the entire formatting, i.e. syntax for that page):
