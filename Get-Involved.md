The EOP platform is developed by the members of the Excitement project and by volunteers and is always looking for new contributors to work on all parts of the project. Every contribution is welcome and can be anything from a small documentation typo fix to new components development and/or modification of exiting ones. In addition we reported a list of already identified projects that may be the subject of undergraduate or graduate theses, or class projects. Before you start to contribute we suggest to join the user and development mailing lists.



### Mailing List

To communicate with the people already involved with EOP to report bugs, suggestions or a personal interest in contributing to the project we provided two different mailing list both available from the Home page of the site (https://github.com/hltfbk/Excitement-Open-Platform/wiki): the first one (i.e. Users) is thought for users who would like to use the platform as it is whereas the second one (i.e. Developers) is for people who would like to give their contribution.



### Events

Getting involved means not only writing code or reporting bugs but also making connections with new people and sharing your research interests. Here we reported the most relevant events related to the Excitement project; for more information please visit the web site of the project: http://www.excitement-project.eu/index.php/news-and-events.

* November 20-22, 2013 - The Joint Symposium on Semantic Processing (JSSP 2013) will take place at FBK in Trento (Italy).

### Projects

EOP is being developed as a reference implementation of algorithms for textual entailment. Extending its functionalities with new algorithms or fixing bugs may be the subject of undergraduate or graduate theses, or class projects. We identified some areas and some specific projects you could be interested in working on:
* code implementation
 * implementing a new component based on tree edit distance
* code distribution
* documentation
