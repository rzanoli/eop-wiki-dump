Excitement Open Platform (EOP) is an open source software platform containing state-of-the-art algorithms for recognizing entailment relations between two portions of text: _given two text fragments, one named text and the other named hypothesis, the task consists in recognizing whether the hypothesis can be inferred from the text._  Written in Java, EOP is a main product of the EXCITEMENT project (http://www.excitement-project.eu/).

EOP's architecture is designed to be efficient and extendable. Highlights include:

* Separation between Linguistic Analysis Pipelines and Entailment Components
* Supporting modularity and interoperability among Components
* Java API with source code
* Pretrained multi-lingual models (i.e. English, German, Italian)
* Trainable with new sample data
