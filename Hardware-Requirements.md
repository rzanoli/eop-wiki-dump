With EOP two different installation are possible depending on the hardware installed on the used computer and the options chose during the installation process. The first one (i.e. the basic installation) is for machines with 4GB of RAM whereas the second one (i.e. the more complete installation) requires at least 5GB of RAM.


## Supported Operative Systems ##

The platform has been tested on Ubuntu (12.04) LTS 64 bits. However, it might be possible to port it to other operative systems given that the majority of the code is written in Java.


## Software Requirements ##

To use the platform the following software is supposed to be already installed:

* [[Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.7 | http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html]] (Please note that JDK 1.6 might not work).
* [[Apache Maven 3.0.x | http://apache.mirror.digionline.de/maven/maven-3/3.0.5/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.5-bin.tar.gz]] (Please note that Apache Maven 2.x might not work).
