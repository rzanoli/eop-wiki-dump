EXCITEMENT Open Platform is released under the terms of [[General Public License (GPL) version 3 | http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html]].

***

The platform can be configured to use different pipelines to process the data sets (e.g. OpenNLP) and different tools and resources (e.g. WordNet) to annotate the data to be annotated. Pipelines, tools, and resources can have licences that are compatible or not compatible with General Public License (GPL) version 3 according to the tables below:

Lib=library, Resource=additional resources (knowledge resources, parsers, tools, etc.)

|<. 4 |<. JWKTL |<. lib |<. [[http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/software/jwktl]] <br>"t the moment, JWKTL is not GPL-compatible, as it is not available as open-source software. However, we plan to release the software soon (possibly in July/August?). So far, we planned to use the Apache License, which would (as far as I know) allow using JWKTL in your GPL software. Please also study the license of the Berkeley DB, which is being used by JWKTL and might imply transitive conditions. Should be no problem though, but still needs consideration" (Christian Meyer)|<. - |
